Installation instructions for libjoystick

General Install:

  1) Copy the libjoystick.so file under either the 32bit or 64bit directory
     depending on the OS you have and put it into the /usr/lib directory or
     somewhere in you library path.

  2) Copy the joystick.h file to the place of you choosing, I use /usr/include for
     ease of including the file.

  3) When compiling you program, include the header file and use the flag
      -ljoystick.

Install/Compiling from Source:

  1) Navigate to the src directory and type make.  Be sure you have the 
     linux/joystick.h header before you do.

  2) Type make install and make sure you have admin privilages.  It will copy
     libjoystick.so to the /usr/lib directory and joystick.h to the /usr/include
     directory.

  Note: To force compile the code as 32bit or 64bit (32bit will work on a 64bit OS, but 
        64 bit WILL NOT work on a 32 bit OS) you have to add some options.
        To force compile for 32bit: make CFLAGS+=-m32
        To force compile for 64bit: make CFLAGS+=-m64 CFLAGS+=-fPIC

  Note: The reason that the joystick.h file has both a C section and a C++ class is so
        the two version of libjoystick are header compatible.  There is libjoystick - a 
        C based joystick library and libjoystick++ a C++ based library that uses a class.
